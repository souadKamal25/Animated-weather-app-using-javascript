<h1>Explanation:</h1>
<ul>
  <li>To obtain an animated weather application I integrated async/await transform from an asynchronous to a synchronous function</li>
  <li>You will see that I used the two methods fetch and axios to retrieve the API concerning the weather from the website: <a href='https://openweathermap.org/api'>https://openweathermap.org/api</a></li>
  <li>In this project you will have the possibility to switch to the two units fahrenheit and celsius, as well as you will have the possibility to search for the weather of your location without entering its name using the keyboard</li>
  <li>the cloneNode() method of javascript helped me a lot to achieve the animated effect which consists of displaying information from top to bottom each time</li>
</ul>
